To do:
- End-to-end acknowlegements
  - Currently there is a na√Øve reliability mechanism on the nodes
    that retransmit packets at every predefined time interval.
    The packet types are flow requests, flow register and neighbor report.
    The controller sends source routed acks for flow register and neighbor report,
    while set flows serve as ack for flow requests.
    It could be improved by:
      1) setting the time dynamically
      2) not accumulating repeated packets in the retransmission window (NR, most importantly)
- Proper statistcs for multiple flow setups
- One hop loop detection
  - Partially adressed by the network layer seq_no repetition detection

Known bugs:
- Node reconnection for null_cd
- Node does not eliminate enqueued flow request packet after receiving flow setup.
- Debug messages on Contiki Controller may cause loss of serial packets
